Fair Use Notice

The audio clips in this repository are brief excerpts (1-5 seconds) from
copyrighted films, used in a transformative context as coding event notification
sounds. This use is believed to qualify as fair use under 17 U.S.C. Section 107.

The clips are:
- Brief (typically 1-5 seconds of audio from feature-length films)
- Transformative (repurposed as IDE notification sounds, not entertainment)
- Non-commercial (freely distributed, no revenue generated)
- Non-substitutional (do not replace or diminish the market for the original works)

All trademarks and copyrights for the original films remain with their
respective owners. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any
